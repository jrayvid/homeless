            <p>On any given night, there are approximately 643,067 people
            experiencing homelessness in America. 238,110 of those people are
            in families. 25% suffer from mental illness, including
            schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. 17% are considered
            chronically homeless. 13% are fleeing domestic violence. 12% are
            veterans.</p>
            <p>Two trends are largely responsible for the rise in homelessness
            in America over the past 20-25 years: a growing shortage of
            affordable rental housing and a simultaneous increase in poverty.
            Persons living in poverty are most at risk of becoming homeless. In
            the United States, homelessness is an undeniable reality that
            impacts people of all ages, ethnicities, and life
            circumstances.</p>
